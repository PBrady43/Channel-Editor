This repository holds files for the perl based Mythtv channel editor.

Full details are in the wiki at:
https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Channel_Editor

The files are:

chedit2.pl         version 2.27 updated 5 June 2022
tutorial.diags     Sample UK data to allow the tutorial.

This code also needs the perl module scan_database.pm obtainable from
https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Perl_API_examples.

Note that changes to both chedit2.pl and scan_database.pm were made in
June 2022 to suit the new test API interface on port 6744 of Mythtv 
version 32 so the code should be compatible with v33.

These files are OBSOLETE and should not be used.  (how can I delete them??)

scan_database.pm   OBSOLETE
chedit.pl          OBSOLETE
